\title{Decrypt an age-encrypted file}
\usage{
file_decrypt(
  input = NULL,
  output = NULL,
  private = NULL,
  passphrase = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character string, path to the age-encrypted file to decrypt}

\item{output}{Character string, path for the decrypted output file. If NULL, returns content as string.}

\item{private}{Character string, path to the private age key file. Cannot be used with passphrase.}

\item{passphrase}{Character string, passphrase for decryption. Cannot be used with private key.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical, whether to overwrite existing output file (ignored when output is NULL)}
}
\value{
If output is provided, returns invisible path to the output file. If output is NULL, returns decrypted content as string.
}
\description{
Decrypts a file that was encrypted with age. Can decrypt using a private key file
(for key-based decryption) or with a passphrase (for passphrase-based decryption).
You must provide either a private key or a passphrase, but not both.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Decrypt to file with private key
file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt", private = "identity.key")

# Decrypt to file with passphrase
file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt", passphrase = "mypassword")

# Decrypt to string (no file output)
content <- file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", output = NULL, private = "identity.key")
content <- file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", output = NULL, passphrase = "mypassword")
}
}
