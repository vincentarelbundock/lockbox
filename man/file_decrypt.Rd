\title{Decrypt an age-encrypted file}
\usage{
file_decrypt(input = NULL, output = NULL, private = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character string, path to the age-encrypted file to decrypt}

\item{output}{Character string, path for the decrypted output file. If NULL, returns content as string.}

\item{private}{Character string, path to the private age key file. If NULL,
will use passphrase decryption and prompt for password.}
}
\value{
If output is provided, returns invisible path to the output file. If output is NULL, returns decrypted content as string.
}
\description{
Decrypts a file that was encrypted with age. Can decrypt using a private key file
(for key-based decryption) or with a passphrase (when no private key provided).
If no private key is specified, will prompt for a passphrase interactively.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Decrypt to file with private key
file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt", private = "identity.key")

# Decrypt to file with passphrase (will prompt)
file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt")

# Decrypt to string (no file output)
content <- file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", output = NULL, private = "identity.key")
content <- file_decrypt("secret.txt.age", output = NULL) # will prompt for passphrase
}
}
