\title{Encrypt strings using age}
\usage{
string_encrypt(input = NULL, public = NULL, armor = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character vector of strings to encrypt}

\item{public}{Character vector of age public keys (recipients). If NULL,
will use passphrase encryption and prompt for password.}

\item{armor}{Logical, whether to use ASCII armor format (only applies to public key encryption)}
}
\value{

(for key-based encryption) or with a passphrase (when no public keys provided).
If no public keys are specified, will prompt for a passphrase interactively.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Encrypt with public key
encrypted <- string_encrypt(c("secret1", "secret2"), public = "age1xyz...")

# Encrypt with passphrase (will prompt)
encrypted <- string_encrypt("my secret")

# Encrypt with armor
encrypted <- string_encrypt("secret", public = "age1xyz...", armor = TRUE)
}
}
