\title{Generate a new age identity (key pair)}
\usage{
age_keygen(keyfile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{keyfile}{Character string, path where the private key will be saved.
The file will contain both public and private key information.}
}
\value{
A \code{lockbox_key} object containing:
\itemize{
\item \verb{$public}: The public key (age recipient identifier)
\item \verb{$private}: The private key
\item \verb{$created}: Timestamp of key creation
}

If the key file already exists, returns the existing public key invisibly
and displays a message rather than overwriting.
}
\description{
Create a new age encryption key pair and save it to a file. The key pair consists
of a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption). If the specified
key file already exists, the function will display the existing public key instead
of overwriting it.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate and save new key to file
key <- age_keygen("my_identity.key")
print(key$public)

# If file already exists, shows existing key without overwriting
age_keygen("my_identity.key")  # Will not overwrite existing key
}

}
