}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character string, path to the age-encrypted file to decrypt}

\item{output}{Character string, path for the decrypted output file}

\item{private}{Character string, path to the private age key file. If NULL,

(for key-based decryption) or by prompting for a passphrase (when no private key provided).
When using passphrase decryption, the user will be prompted to enter the password.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Decrypt with private key
age_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt", private = "identity.key")

# Decrypt with passphrase (will prompt)
age_decrypt("secret.txt.age", "secret.txt")
}
