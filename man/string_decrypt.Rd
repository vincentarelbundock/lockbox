\title{Decrypt age-encrypted strings}
\usage{
string_decrypt(input = NULL, private = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Character vector of age-encrypted strings to decrypt}

\item{private}{Character string, path to the private age key file. If NULL,
will use passphrase decryption and prompt for password.}
}
\value{
Character vector of decrypted strings
}
\description{
Decrypts strings that were encrypted with age. Can decrypt using a private key file
(for key-based decryption) or with a passphrase (when no private key provided).
If no private key is specified, will prompt for a passphrase interactively.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Decrypt with private key
decrypted <- string_decrypt(encrypted_strings, private = "identity.key")

# Decrypt with passphrase (will prompt)
decrypted <- string_decrypt(encrypted_strings)
}
}
