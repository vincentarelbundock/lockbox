# lockbox: Simple File Encryption and Secrets Management in R

> Simple file encryption and secret management for R using modern cryptographic tools. Provides functions to encrypt/decrypt files with 'age' and manage secrets in encrypted YAML files with 'SOPS'. Secrets can be easily exported as environment variables for use with APIs and services. Supports both file-based and in-memory key management workflows.

This package is designed for Vincent's personal use. If it is useful to you, great! But there are no guarantees that the implemented workflows are totally secure, or that the user interface will be remain stable.

## Why?

`lockbox` targets two main use cases:

1. _File Encryption_: R users need an easy way to encrypt and decrypt files using simple, modern, secure encryption methods. The package supports simple passwords and support key pair workflows.
2. _Secrets Management_: Many R packages, functions, and services rely on environment variables to retrieve users' API keys, security tokens, and assorted secrets (ex: LLM APIs, AWS services, database locations, etc.). Users need a secure way to store secrets in an encrypted file, and a convenient way to export those secrets as environment variables. Although there are solutions for this outside R, it is useful to do it within to ensure that variables are accessible in the current R session.

## How?

To solve these problems, `lockbox` provides a convenience wrapper around two command line tools: 

1. The [age](https://age-encryption.org) encryption tool.
2. The [SOPS](https://getsops.io/) secrets manager.

### `age`: encryption

[age](https://age-encryption.org) is a simple and modern file encryption tool with small keys, no configuration options, and high security. It is designed to replace tools like GPG for most file encryption tasks.

There are two main encryption strategies with `age`: passphrase or key pairs.

The first is simplest. A passphrase is assigned when encrypting the file. Then, whenever someone wishes to decrypt the file, they are prompted to supply that same password.

The second strategy relies on a pair of keys:

1. Public key: a *shareable* string used for encryption.
2. Private key: a *secret* file for decryption.

This situation illustrates the use of key pairs:

1. Bob wants to send a secret file to Alice.
2. Alice shares her public key with Bob. 
3. Bob uses Alice's public key to encrypt the file. 
4. Bob sends the encrypted file to Alice. 
5. Alice uses her private key to decrypt the file.

Anyone with your public key can encrypt files for you, but only you can decrypt them with your private key.

### `SOPS`: organize and export secrets

[SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) is a secrets manager which `lockbox` uses for two main purposes:

1. Organize secrets in an encrypted "lockbox" file in YAML format.
2. Export the secrets held in a lockbox as environment variables, so that other R processes and functions can access API keys, security tokens, etc.

You must _never_ edit your `lockbox.yaml` file manually. Always use the provided functions or `sops` to ensure the file remains valid and encrypted.

## Installation

The `lockbox` package uses the [age](https://age-encryption.org) encryption format through a Rust implementation, so you need to install Rust to compile the package. The easiest way to install Rust is through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```sh
# Install Rust (all platforms)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# Follow the installation prompts, then restart your terminal
```

For secrets management, you also need to install the `sops` command line tool:

* [SOPS website](https://getsops.io/)

```sh
# macOS
brew install sops

# Windows
choco install sops

# Linux
# Use your distribution's package manager
```

Once Rust and SOPS are installed, you can install the development version of `lockbox` from Github:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("vincentarelbundock/lockbox")
```


## Keys

Our first step is to create a private/public key pair using the `key_generate()` function. The private key is saved to a file and should be kept secret. The public key can be shared and is used to encrypt data.

```{r}
library(lockbox)
key <- key_generate("private.key")
key
```

This command created a local "identity file," which holds both the public and private keys. The function returns the public key directly as a string.

```{r}
file.exists("private.key")
```

::::{.callout-warning}
**Do not share the `private.key` file**. It should be kept secret and secure.

**Security Note**: The private key file is created with default system permissions, which may be readable by other users. After generating a key, set secure permissions:

```r
# On Unix/Linux/macOS:
Sys.chmod("private.key", "0600")  # Owner read/write only
```
::::

## Use-case 1: Encrypting files

`lockbox` can encrypt and decrypt arbitrary files. To illustrate, let's create a file with some text in it.

```{r}
# write file
cat("Very sensitive data.\n", file = "sensitive.txt")

# make sure we can read it
readLines("sensitive.txt")
```

Now, let's use the public key and the `file_encrypt()` function to encrypt the file. The `.age` suffix is added automatically to the file name, and the content becomes gibberish.

```{r}
#| warning: false
file_encrypt(
  input = "sensitive.txt",
  public = key
)

readLines("sensitive.txt.age")
```

Finally, we can decrypt the file using the private key file. The decrypted content is written to the specified output file.

```{r}
file_decrypt(
  input = "sensitive.txt.age",
  output = "sensitive_decrypted.txt",
  private = "private.key"
)

readLines("sensitive_decrypted.txt")
```

## Use-case 2: Storing secrets in a `lockbox` and exporting them as environment variables

Several packages and applications require users to export secrets as environment variables for easy access. For example, you may need to store a security key to access the API of an LLM provider; the location of your private database; or credentials to access AWS services. 

Generally speaking, we do *not* want to store those secrets in plain text files. Instead, we can store them in an encrypted YAML file, and use a helper function to decrypt the file and export environment variables. 

First, we define a named list with the values that we wish to store securely. Then, we call `secrets_encrypt()` to encrypt those secrets into our lockbox file. Again, we use the public key for encryption.

```{r}
secrets <- list(
  API_KEY = "your-api-key-here",
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db",
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
)

secrets_encrypt(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  secrets = secrets,
  public = key
)
```

## Retrieving secrets from a `lockbox`

Now, we can retrieve all secrets using our private key file.

```{r}
secrets_decrypt(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  private = "private.key"
)
```

## Modifying secrets in a `lockbox`

To modify existing secrets or to add new ones, we can simply call `secrets_encrypt()` again. In this case, however, we need to supply the `private` key file because modifying requires us to read the existing secrets.

```{r}
secrets_encrypt(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  secrets = list("API_KEY" = "a-new-api-key"),
  private = "private.key"
)
```

We see that the `API_KEY` value has indeed been updated.

```{r}
secrets_decrypt(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  private = "private.key")$API_KEY
```

## Exporting secrets as environment variables

Finally, we can export all secrets from the lockbox file as environment variables. This is useful when running applications that rely on environment variables for configuration.

```{r}
secrets_export(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  private = "private.key"
)
```

And we see that the secrets are indeed available in the environment.

```{r}
Sys.getenv("API_KEY")
Sys.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
```

## Enhanced Security: Encrypting Your Private Key

For even more security, you can encrypt your private key file itself using a passphrase. This adds an extra layer of protection - even if someone gains access to your key file, they would need to know the passphrase to use it.

#### Step 1: Encrypt the private key with a passphrase.

```{r}
#| eval: false
file_encrypt(
  input = "private.key",
  output = "private.key.age"
)
# You will be prompted to enter a secure passphrase
```

When you run this command, you'll be prompted to enter a passphrase. Make sure you choose a strong, memorable passphrase as you'll need it every time you use the encrypted key file.

#### Step 2: Remove the unencrypted key file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
unlink("private.key")
```

#### Step 3: Use the password-protected key file.

Now you can use your password-protected key file with all the same functions. The lockbox package will automatically detect that it's an encrypted key file and prompt you for the passphrase when needed.

```{r}
#| eval: false
secrets_decrypt(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  private = "private.key.age"
)
# You will be prompted for your passphrase

secrets_export(
  lockbox = "lockbox.yaml",
  private = "private.key.age"
)
# You will be prompted for your passphrase
```

## Security Considerations

::::{.callout-warning}
**Temporary File Handling**

There are two cases where `lockbox` creates temporary files with sensitive data:

1. When the `private` key used in `secrets_decrypt()` or `file_decrypt()` is itself passphrase-encrypted.
2. When calling `secrets_encrypt()` to modify an existing `lockbox` file. 

In both cases, a file is written to disk at `tempfile()`, and is automatically deleted using `on.exit()` and `unlink()` to ensure cleanup on function exit even if an error occurs.

While this approach follows R best practices for temporary file handling, users with heightened security requirements may prefer to run `age` and `sops` directly from the command line to maintain full control over key file handling.

```{r}
#| include: false
trash <- c("private.key", "private.key.age", "sensitive.txt", "sensitive.txt.age", "sensitive_decrypted.txt", "lockbox.yaml")
sapply(trash, unlink, force = TRUE)
```
