    "title": "lockbox: Simple File Encryption and Secrets Management in R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Simple file encryption and secret management for R using modern cryptographic tools. Provides functions to encrypt/decrypt files with ‘age’ and manage secrets in encrypted YAML files with ‘SOPS’. Secrets can be easily exported as environment variables for use with APIs and services. Supports both file-based and in-memory key management workflows.\n\n\n\nlockbox targets two main use cases:\n\nFile Encryption: R users need an easy way to encrypt and decrypt files using simple, modern, secure encryption methods. The functions should allow simple passwords and support key pair workflows.\nSecret Management: Many R packages, functions, and services rely on environment variables to retrieve users’ API keys and security tokens (LLM APIs, AWS services, database locations, etc.). Users need a secure way to store secrets in an encrypted file, and a convenient way to export those secrets as environment variables. Although there are solutions for this outside R, it is useful to do it within to ensure that variables are accessible in the current R session.\n\n\n\n\nTo solve these problems, lockbox provides a convenience wrapper around two command line tools:\n\nThe age encryption tool.\nThe SOPS secrets manager.\n\n\n\nage is a simple and modern file encryption tool with small keys, no configuration options, and high security. It is designed to replace tools like GPG for most file encryption tasks.\nThere are two main encryption strategies with age: passphrase or key pairs.\nThe first is simplest. A passphrase when encrypting the file. Whenever we wish to decrypt the file, we are prompted to supply that same password.\nThe second strategy relies on a pair of keys:\n\nPublic key: a (shareable) string used for encryption.\nPrivate key: a (secret) file for decryption.\n\nThis situation illustrates the use of key pairs:\n\nBob wants to send a secret file to Alice.\nAlice shares her public key with Bob.\nBob uses Alice’s public key to encrypt the file.\nBob sends the encrypted file to Alice.\nAlice uses her private key to decrypt the file.\n\nAnyone with your public key can encrypt files for you, but only you can decrypt them with your private key.\n\n\n\nSOPS is a secrets manager which lockbox uses for two main purposes:\n\nOrganize secrets in an encrypted “lockbox” file in YAML format.\nExport secrets as environment variables to other R processes access to API keys, security tokens, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou must never edit your lockbox.yaml file manually. Always use the provided functions or sops to ensure the file remains valid and encrypted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use the lockbox package, you must first install the age and sops command line tools. Both tools are free and available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nYou can find installation instructions on their respective websites:\n\nhttps://age-encryption.org\nSOPS website\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, click on the links above. Most users will it easy to use a package manager like Homebrew (MacOS) or Chocolatey (Windows) to install these tools.\n# macOS\nbrew install age sops\n\n# Windows\nchoco install age.portable\nchoco install sops\n\n# Linux\n# Use your distributions package manager\nThen, you can install the development version of lockbox from Github:\nremotes::install_github(\"vincentarelbundock/lockbox\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first step is to create a private/public key pair using the key_generate.R() function. The private key is saved to a file and should be kept secret. The public key can be shared and is used to encrypt data.\n\nlibrary(lockbox)\nkey &lt;- key_generate.R(\"private.key\")\nkey\n\nKey created:  2025-08-07 08:26:12 \nPublic key:  age1akm563lv324w9k396jk9m2fpwlnrqu9d4tjyd8yfmkn6l5spypnsznqd9c \nPrivate key: AGE-SECRET-KEY-********* \n\n\nThis command created a local “identity file,” which holds both the public and private keys.\n\nfile.exists(\"private.key\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe private.key file contains your private key. Do not share this file. It should be kept secret and secure.\n\n\n\n\n\nlockbox can encrypt and decrypt arbitrary files. To illustrate, let’s create a file with some text in it.\n\n# write file\ncat(\"Very sensitive data.\\n\", file = \"sensitive.txt\")\n\n# make sure we can read it\nreadLines(\"sensitive.txt\")\n\n[1] \"Very sensitive data.\"\n\n\nNow, let’s use the public key and the file_encrypt() function to encrypt the file. A .age suffix is added, and the content becomes gibberish.\n\nfile_encrypt(\n  input = \"sensitive.txt\",\n  public = key$public\n)\n\nreadLines(\"sensitive.txt.age\")\n\n[1] \"age-encryption.org/v1\"                                                          \n[2] \"-&gt; X25519 qmub95+Q48p6wk1BqHCpY0AKZWoA2RqoNCNvzrq79xU\"                          \n[3] \"11BXCMoYCh0A770Q4wJF7cIvZXJJPsU1/aU73Yc6Dkk\"                                    \n[4] \"--- eDUU2dnXBJSlH8T1nUQGguwJ16CqjVLDitBhSVBaFHE\"                                \n[5] \")&gt;\\xb7\\xf0\\xed \\035Ʀl\\xee\\x8eC\\x88\\xd0\\xd5*B\\xc5'\\x84c\\x98\\x9b\\xc4\\xd4\\xf6\\032G\"\n\n\nFinally, we can decrypt the file using the private key file. The decrypted content is written to the specified output file.\n\nfile_decrypt(\n  input = \"sensitive.txt.age\",\n  output = \"sensitive_decrypted.txt\",\n  private = \"private.key\"\n)\n\nreadLines(\"sensitive_decrypted.txt\")\n\n[1] \"Very sensitive data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral packages and applications require users to export secrets as environment variables for easy access. For example, you may need to store a security key to access the API of an LLM provider; the location of your private database; or credentials to access AWS services.\nGenerally speaking, we do not want to store those secrets in plain text files. Instead, we can store them in an encrypted YAML file, and use a helper function to decrypt the file and export environment variables.\nFirst, we define a named list with the values that we wish to store securely. Then, we call secrets_encrypt() to encrypt those secrets into our lockbox file. Again, we use the public key for encryption.\n\nsecrets &lt;- list(\n  API_KEY = \"your-api-key-here\",\n  DATABASE_URL = \"postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db\",\n  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\"\n)\n\nsecrets_encrypt(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  secrets = secrets,\n  public = key$public\n)\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can retrieve all secrets using our private key file.\n\nsecrets_decrypt(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  private = \"private.key\"\n)\n\n$API_KEY\n[1] \"your-api-key-here\"\n\n$DATABASE_URL\n[1] \"postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db\"\n\n$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\n[1] \"AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo modify existing secrets or to add new ones, we can simply call secrets_encrypt() again. In this case, however, we need to supply the private key file because modifying requires us to read the existing secrets.\n\nsecrets_encrypt(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  secrets = list(\"API_KEY\" = \"a-new-api-key\"),\n  private = \"private.key\"\n)\n\nWe see that the API_KEY value has indeed been updated.\n\nsecrets_decrypt(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  private = \"private.key\")$API_KEY\n\n[1] \"a-new-api-key\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can export all secrets from the lockbox file as environment variables. This is useful when running applications that rely on environment variables for configuration.\n\nsecrets_export(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  private = \"private.key\"\n)\n\nAnd we see that the secrets are indeed available in the environment.\n\nSys.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\n\n[1] \"a-new-api-key\"\n\nSys.getenv(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n\n[1] \"postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor even more security, you can encrypt your private key file itself using a passphrase. This adds an extra layer of protection - even if someone gains access to your key file, they would need to know the passphrase to use it.\n\n\n\nfile_encrypt(\n  input = \"private.key\",\n  output = \"private.key.age\"\n)\n# You will be prompted to enter a secure passphrase\n\nWhen you run this command, you’ll be prompted to enter a passphrase. Choose a strong, memorable passphrase.\n\n\n\n\nunlink(\"private.key\")\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use your password-protected key file with all the same functions. The lockbox package will automatically detect that it’s an encrypted key file and prompt you for the passphrase when needed.\n\nsecrets_decrypt(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  private = \"private.key.age\"\n)\n# You will be prompted for your passphrase\n\nsecrets_export(\n  lockbox = \"lockbox.yaml\",\n  private = \"private.key.age\"\n)\n# You will be prompted for your passphrase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTemporary File Handling\nThere are two cases where lockbox creates temporary files with sensitive data:\n\nWhen the private key used in secrets_decrypt() or file_decrypt() is itself passphrase-encrypted.\nWhen calling secrets_encrypt() to modify an existing lockbox file.\n\nIn both cases, a file is written to disk at tempfile() automatically deleted using on.exit() and unlink() to ensure cleanup on function exit even if an error occurs.\nWhile this approach follows R best practices for temporary file handling, users with heightened security requirements may prefer to run age and sops commands directly from the command line to maintain full control over key file handling.",

The functions should allow simple passwords and support key pair workflows.\nSecret Management: Many R packages, functions, and services rely on environment variables to retrieve users’ API keys and security tokens (LLM APIs, AWS services, database locations, etc.). Users need a secure way to store secrets in an encrypted file, and a convenient way to export those secrets as environment variables. Although there are solutions for this outside R, it is useful to do it within to ensure that variables are accessible in the current R session.",

    "text": "To solve these problems, lockbox provides a convenience wrapper around two command line tools:\n\nThe age encryption tool.\nThe SOPS secrets manager.\n\n\n\nage is a simple and modern file encryption tool with small keys, no configuration options, and high security. It is designed to replace tools like GPG for most file encryption tasks.\nThere are two main encryption strategies with age: passphrase or key pairs.\nThe first is simplest. A passphrase when encrypting the file. Whenever we wish to decrypt the file, we are prompted to supply that same password.\nThe second strategy relies on a pair of keys:\n\nPublic key: a (shareable) string used for encryption.\nPrivate key: a (secret) file for decryption.\n\nThis situation illustrates the use of key pairs:\n\nBob wants to send a secret file to Alice.\nAlice shares her public key with Bob.\nBob uses Alice’s public key to encrypt the file.\nBob sends the encrypted file to Alice.\nAlice uses her private key to decrypt the file.\n\nAnyone with your public key can encrypt files for you, but only you can decrypt them with your private key.\n\n\n\nSOPS is a secrets manager which lockbox uses for two main purposes:\n\nOrganize secrets in an encrypted “lockbox” file in YAML format.\nExport secrets as environment variables to other R processes access to API keys, security tokens, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou must never edit your lockbox.yaml file manually.
